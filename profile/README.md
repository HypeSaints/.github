A group of hipsters stumble on some mysterious extraterrestrial power from a gameboy looked digital Bible and become capable of mind-rigging during game adventuring. But the power residing in their brains seems to have a will of its own. The chapter of +revelation+ from the game reveals to Hipster Jesus that another secret group on earth have access to the same video game, and they are up to something evil. Now, Js and his friends are to seek out their enemies and stop the evil agenda before it is too late “The judgement day”.
